Call test file from command line : python hashtable_test.py

Any other external tests can be written the same way as the test file submitted.

The HashTable implementation here is in Python can do everything asked for, and can also resize when exceeding the set load value of 0.7.
This is very useful and efficient and the resizing runs in amortized O(1) time. All functions run as expected, along with two other functions
which are the __str__() and resize() functions.
